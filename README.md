# ScrapeIt
Scraping is done this way 


## What it does 
Basically i have used pupeteer library provided and maintained by google
that provides headless browser which can be used for testing as well as tasks
like web scraping

## How to run it

`npm i`

for now the headless property of pupeteer driven chromium browser has been kept as `false` so that every action is visible to make sure what is happening

#

for now i have read everything that needs to be done and know to implement it. If you would like to know how, as the assignment is not completed, we can definitely sync up.
