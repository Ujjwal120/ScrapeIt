# ScrapeIt
Scraping is done this way 


## What it does 
Basically i have used pupeteer library provided and maintained by google
that provides headless browser which can be used for testing as well as tasks
like web scraping

## How to run it

`npm i`

for now the headless property of pupeteer driven chromium browser has been kept as `false` so that every action is visible to make sure what is happening

#

It is up and running now !!!!
